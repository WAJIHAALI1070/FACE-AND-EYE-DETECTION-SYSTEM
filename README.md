# Face and Eye Detection System

A simple Facial Detection Engine built in Python using Pre-trained Haar Classifiers.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes Python and OpenCV for detecting faces and eyes using pre-trained Haar cascades. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with tkinter for interactive use.

### Project Contents

- **Face_detect.py:** Contains the main code for the face and eye detection.
- **BG-App2.png:** Background image used in the main window of the application.
- **fc-scan.ico:** Icon image for the application's window.
- **Help Window.png:** Background image for the help window.

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3
2. An IDE (preferably PyCharm)
3. A Camera/Webcam

### Libraries Used

- `opencv-python`: For face and eye detection.
- `tkinter`: For the graphical user interface (built-in library).
- `numpy`: Optional dependency.

### Setup Instructions

1. Create a folder named 'Images' in the directory where `Face_detect.py` is located.
2. Modify the image directory paths in the code if Images are saved elsewhere.
3. Connect your Webcam/Camera.
4. Adjust the `cam_index` variable in the code based on your camera setup (0 for built-in camera, 1, 2, etc., for secondary cameras).

### Usage

Run `Face_detect.py` in your IDE. Ensure your camera is connected and properly configured.

### Additional Notes

- For best results, ensure adequate lighting conditions for the camera.
- This project is intended for educational purposes and can be extended for various real-world applications.
